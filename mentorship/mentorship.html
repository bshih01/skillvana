							<h3>Marta Knoth</h3>
							<p>As a material science major, I was at a crossroads with too many paths after college. That's when I discovered Skillvana's mentorship program, which connected me with Maya, a materials engineer with a decade of experience in the industry. My mentor, Maya, opened my eyes to the vast possibilities in material science. From biodegradable materials to cutting-edge industrial applications, she helped me navigate potential career paths. Our discussions went from theoretical aspects of materials to their practical impact in the world. With her encouragement, I interned at a renewable materials startup, which shaped my decision to pursue a career in sustainable materials. Maya's mentorship didn't just guide me. It gave me a vision for my future.</p>
